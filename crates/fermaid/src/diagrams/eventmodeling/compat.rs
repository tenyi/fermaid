//! Mermaid's event modeling specs, as pele ports them. The cases are generated into
//! `tests/compat/eventmodeling/cases.rs` by `cargo xtask compat`, and what the reference makes
//! of each into `expected.rs` by `tools/oracle/golden.mjs`: the reference parses the source with
//! Mermaid's own Langium grammar and fills the model with pele's port of Mermaid's event
//! modeling database, so a case on which fermaid's model matches the reference's passes as
//! well. Every case is either checked or listed in `tests/compat/eventmodeling/SKIPPED.md`.
