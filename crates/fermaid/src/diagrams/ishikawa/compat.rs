//! Mermaid's Ishikawa specs, as pele ports them. The cases are generated into
//! `tests/compat/ishikawa/cases.rs` by `cargo xtask compat`, and what the parser Mermaid
//! generates from its own grammar makes of each into `expected.rs` by
//! `tools/oracle/golden.mjs`: Mermaid passes these specs, so a case on which fermaid's model
//! matches Mermaid's passes as well. Every case is either checked or listed in
//! `tests/compat/ishikawa/SKIPPED.md`.
