# Skipped flowchart specs

The cases in `cases.rs` come from pele 1.9.0's port of the Mermaid 12.1.0 flowchart specs, through
`cargo xtask compat flowchart --pele <DIR>`. `expected.rs` holds what pele makes of each, written
by `node tools/oracle/golden.mjs <DIR> flowchart`. `src/diagrams/flowchart/compat.rs` checks
that fermaid's model of every case not listed here matches pele's: the same nodes, edges,
subgraphs, classes, tooltips and accessibility text, or an error of the same kind. pele passes
these specs, except for the two its own `SKIPPED.md` lists, which concern how Mermaid stores
`<` and Jison internals.

The cases are run with the default limits, so the specs that set `maxEdges` or `inheritDir`
are checked with Mermaid's defaults; fermaid's own tests cover those settings.

## Skipped tests

- `[Edges] when parsing > edge length > should handle dotted edges with arrows with length ${length}`: The source is built from values in the test code, which the extractor does not evaluate. The same syntax is covered by the cases around it.
- `[Edges] when parsing > edge length > should handle dotted edges with double arrows with length ${length}`: The source is built from values in the test code, which the extractor does not evaluate. The same syntax is covered by the cases around it.
- `[Edges] when parsing > edge length > should handle dotted edges with length ${length}`: The source is built from values in the test code, which the extractor does not evaluate. The same syntax is covered by the cases around it.
- `[Edges] when parsing > edge length > should handle dotted labelled edges with arrows with length ${length}`: The source is built from values in the test code, which the extractor does not evaluate. The same syntax is covered by the cases around it.
